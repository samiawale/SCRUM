# SCRUM
here you find our SCRUM in Practice Project...

We created a website for a German company called 'Stadtgarten und Friedh√∂fer' that manages all the trees in the city of Magdeburg.
Our team applied the Scrum method under the guidance of Prof. Ortmeier for our final project in the 'Scrum in Practice' course at Otto-von-Guericke University.

We developed a map that displays all the trees in Magdeburg, including details and filtering options based on location or specific information.

The website currently lacks some features, but we are actively working on making it a fully functional platform where users can register and login as either an employee or manager. We will also be adding a feature to allow users to become helpers for this company.
